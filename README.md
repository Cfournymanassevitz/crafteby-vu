# Crafteby-Vu: A Vue 3 Starter Template

Welcome to Crafteby-Vu, a robust template designed to kickstart your development with Vue 3 and Vite. This guide will walk you through the setup process and introduce you to some of the project's key features.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

For an optimal development experience, we recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your IDE. Enhance your Vue development with the [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) extension. Remember to disable Vetur if it's installed.

## Customizing Your Vite Configuration

Vite offers a wealth of configuration options to tailor your development and build processes. Refer to the [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/) for detailed information.

## Getting Your Project Up and Running

Before you start, ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system. You can verify this by running `node --version` and `npm --version` in your terminal. If you need to install Node.js and npm, you can download them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once Node.js and npm are ready, open a terminal and follow these steps to set up your project:

```sh
# Install the necessary packages
npm install

```

Navigate to your project directory with `cd <your-project-name>`.

## Available Scripts

Your new project comes with several pre-configured npm scripts:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with hot-reloading enabled.
- `npm run build`: Compiles your application for production.
- `npm run lint`: Checks your code for quality and formatting issues with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).
